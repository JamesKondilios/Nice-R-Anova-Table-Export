# Nice-R-Anova-Table-Export

There's currently no function in R to export an anova summary table as an image. Screenshotting the table from the consol looks ugly.
This script is an answer to this problem. 

The 'Display_AnovaSummary' function takes a summary.aov object and produces a graphical represntation of it. It also adds significance asterisks to the P-value column.
